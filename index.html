    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>I am currently studying accounting and computer science at Mount St. Joseph University. 
        I chose these majors because I am interested in both business and technology, and I like learning how systems work behind the scenes. 
        Accounting helps me understand how money is tracked and managed, while computer science helps me think logically and solve problems using code.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, playing baseball, and playing the guitar. 
        I have one sister and two parents, and my family has always supported me in both school and baseball.</p>

    <p>This website is being hosted using GitHub Pages as part of my INF-250 class.</p>
